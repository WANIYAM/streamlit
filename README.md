# Growth Mindset Challenge: Web App with Streamlit

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
This repository contains a web app built using **Streamlit** and **UV** as part of the **Growth Mindset Challenge**. The challenge is designed to encourage continuous learning, problem-solving, and innovation while developing Python-based applications.

## ðŸ§  What is a Growth Mindset?
A **growth mindset** is the belief that abilities and intelligence can be developed through dedication, learning, and hard work. This challenge helps apply that mindset by pushing us to explore new technologies and improve our problem-solving skills.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
- Develop a **Streamlit-based** web application.
- Implement **UV** for backend logic.
- Deploy the app online and share it with peers.
- Keep the **source code private** while making the app publicly accessible.
- Learn, innovate, and enhance the project beyond the basic tutorial.

## ðŸ“Œ How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/growth-mindset-challenge.git
   cd growth-mindset-challenge
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the App Locally:**
